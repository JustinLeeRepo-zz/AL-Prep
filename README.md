# AL-Prep
  
Reviewing Obj C Foundations before coming onboard AL  
Have used these in my projects and now getting a formal explanation  
Will probably also comment my notes I handwrite into the code  
This is not my first time learning Obj C  
Please refer to my other previous projects in my repo or refer to the apps in the appstore  
Those previous projects will show you that I know the "what" and "how" of Obj C  
  
But...  
  
This is strictly so that I can hit the ground running at full speed when I begin at AL
As well as being able to explain the questions that really show your chops, "WHY?!...??.."
